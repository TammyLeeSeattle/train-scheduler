# train-scheduler
This is Week 7 Homework for the UW Programming Bootcamp. Check it out here: [https://tammyleeseattle.github.io/train-scheduler/](https://tammyleeseattle.github.io/train-scheduler/)



## Aim of the Application
For those looking for a light-weight place to store train data -- name of the train, destination of the train, how frequently the train travels, the next time it'll arrive (wherever you are), and how many minutes away the train is -- well, you've found your application.

## Getting Started
In the table called "Add Train to Schedule", insert the name of the train, the destination of the train, the first train departure time (in military time), and the frequency of departure (in minutes).

Then select "Add to Train Schedule"!

Then refresh the page, and you should see a new schedule, new addition and updated Next Arrival and Minutes Away time!

## User Disclaimer Notes
By "light-weight", I mean that this project uses a real-time database via Google Firebase. After a value is input, it's stored forever until manually removed from Firebase. Yes, this is weird, and yes, it's expected because hey, I'm new to this :)
