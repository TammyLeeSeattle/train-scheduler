# train-scheduler
This is Week 7 Homework for the UW Programming Bootcamp.

## Aim of the Application
For those looking for a light-weight place to store train data -- name of the train, destination of the train, how frequently the train travels, the next time it'll arrive (wherever you are), and how many minutes away the train is -- well, you've found your application.

## Getting Started
In the table called "Add Train to Schedule", insert the name of the train, the destination of the train, the first train departure time (in military time), and the frequency of departure (in minutes).

Then select "Add to Train Schedule"!

Then refresh the page, and you should see a new schedule, new addition and updated Next Arrival and Minutes Away time!
